                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <h2>Create your account</h2>
                <p>The first step is to create a free account. This will give you free access to the full system for a month. </p>
                <p class="note">If you have a very complex payroll or just need a little more time to figure out if Smart Pay is right for you, let us know we can normally extend the trial out.</p>
                <p>To create your account simply follow the <b>Get Started</b> link from the top of <a target="_blank" href="https://smartpay.im/">smartpay.im</a> or follow this link. <a target="_blank" href="https://app.smartpay.im/Identity/Account/Register">Register user.</a></p>
                <p>This is where you set your email address and password, make it a good one as it is keeping your payroll safe. When it's all in click the <b>Register</b> button.</p>
                <p>If you want to turn on two-factor authentication, this can be done from the settings inside Smart Pay. If you don't know what two-factor authentication is, the short answer is it's a security thing and a good idea. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://computing.which.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/360000243980-What-is-two-factor-authentication-and-should-you-use-it-">longer explanation</a> if you want to know more.</p>
                <p>Smart Pay will send you an email to confirm your email address. So you should have a new email with the subject <b>Confirm your email</b>. This is likely the first email we have sent you so if you can't find it don't forget to check your spam folder.</p>
                <p>In the email, there is a <b>Verify your email</b> button follow this to confirm your address. That's your account setup. Follow the <b>Login</b> link to log in.
                    This might be a good time to bookmark the login page or <a target="_blank" href="https://app.smartpay.im">https://app.smartpay.im</a> so you can get back easily.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div id="getting-started-setupcompany">
                <h2>Set up your company</h2>
                <p>Once you have signed in you will be taken to a welcome screen. You can buy a licence at this point, but for this manual, we are assuming you are going for the free trial. So follow the <b>Start Free Trial</b> button.</p>
                <p>The next screen asks for a few basic details about your company. If you don't have something like your ITIP Reference on you right now, don't worry it can always be filled in later. When you are finished click <b>Next</b>.</p>
                <p>Departments, Smart Pay breaks employees up into departments, you need to have at least one department, but you can have as many as you want. Just click <b>Add Department</b> and give it a name. Once you are ready click <b>Next</b>.</p>
                <p>Pay Frequencies, how often do you pay your staff? Smart Pay supports Monthly, 4 Weekly and Weekly. Just tick the ones that apply to your company and then <b>Next</b>.</p>
                <p>Banking, allows you to create bank files with the full list of payments for each payroll. This can be uploaded to your bank's website to process the payments in one go. If this sounds useful click <b>Yes</b>. If you do this manually or you pay your staff by cheque click <b>No</b>.</p>
                <p>That's your company all set up. If you want to change anything click <b>Back</b> to go back a page, if you are happy click <b>Create</b>.</p>
                <p class="note">Smart Pay automatically saves the page every time you change fields or click on a button. So don't worry about saving your progress, it will all still be there when you log back in. Also fields like the Registration number that always come in a specific format have placeholder text to give you a bit of a hit of what we're expecting.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="getting-started-people">
                <h2>Add your people</h2>
                <p>You can't have a payroll without people. So the next step is to add a few details about the people you will be paying. </p>
                <p class="note">For the sake of this manual we are assuming you are paying employees not sub-contractors, sub-contractors work a little differently. We will cover sub-contractors in a future manual. Until then if you are paying sub-contractors, please let us know and we will be happy to walk you through the process.</p>
                <p>Now you have your company set up, you should be looking at the People list. To add your first employee just click the <b>Add</b> button at the top.</p>
                <p>First, off it will ask you a few personal details about your employee. Forename, Surname, Address. Once you have those details in. Click <b>Next</b>.</p>
                <p>Second, it asks for salary information. This lets you select the payroll, to dictate how often the employee is paid. as well as set their salary and working hours. Once you are happy click <b>Next</b>.</p>
                <p class="note">For monthly payrolls, the salary pay items are worked out from the annual salary down. This means you can input their annual salary and the monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly rates are worked out automatically. Click the <b>Salary breakdown</b> link if you would like to change these manually.</p>
                <p>Next, is the NI and tax reference numbers. Not much to say here.</p>
                <p>Pension, if you or your employee contribute directly to their pension this is where you input the values. The contributions will be included in each payroll automatically, but they can always be overridden if needed.</p>
                <p>Click <b>Finish</b> and your employee is set up. You can now close your first employee and run your first payroll or add another employee.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="getting-started-payroll">
                <h2>Run your first payroll</h2>
                <p>Once your employees are set up, run your payroll by selecting <b>Company</b> on the left menu then clicking <b>Run Payroll</b> next to the payroll name.</p>
                <p>After a second, you will be shown the <a href="#payroll-details">Payroll Details</a>. This is where you can add any new pay types or change the employee's hours.</p>
                <p>Once you are happy click <b>Complete</b>. Smart Pay will then work out all the payment lines and create the payslip reports for your payroll run. From here by clicking on an employee's name you can see their payment breakdown as well as print out their payslip. You can also print out Pension, Accounting and Payment List reports and of course email the payslips directly to all your employees.</p>
                <p class="note">If you have input banking details for your company and employees this is where you can download the bank instruction file to upload to your bank's website. If not the Payment List report will give you a breakdown of the payments due to each employee.</p>
                <p>If something doesn't look right, the <b>Remove</b> button will take you back to the <a href="#payroll-details">Payroll Details</a> so you can make any changes necessary. </p>
                <p>If you need to come back to the payroll later, an <b>open payroll</b>, one that hasn't been completed yet, can be reopened by going to <b>Company</b> and clicking on the payroll name under open payrolls.

                <p>If your company is growing and you need to pay more employees, the licence button will allow you to change your licence level.

            <div id="company-open-projects">

                <p>Projects are categories the employee timesheets can be grouped into. When an employee puts in a timesheet line from the employee portal they will be given the list of projects to pick from. They would normally be based on the pay types the employees have available such as standard time, overtime and the like. Or if the employee does client work then they could just as well be linked to a client-specific code.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="company-open-email-template">
                <h2>Email Templates</h2>
                <p>The Email Template allows you to override the standard wording when payslips are sent out to your employees.</p>
                <p>To edit the template click the edit button to the right. Then simply enter the payslip email wording and a preview of the final email will appear below.</p>
                <p>For values that will change between emails, the template uses placeholders that get replaced by the real values when the email is sent. The preview uses a payment to a fictitious employee called "Jane Doe" to allow you to see what it would look like in a real email.</p>
                <p>To use the placeholders simply put the value name between braces in place of the real value. So to add a greeting to the top of your email you might start by inputting "Dear {title} {surname}" that would then come out as "Dear Miss Doe".</p>
                <img src="screenshots/email-template.png" alt="email template" />
                <p>The placeholders currently supported are.</p>

                <p>The people page lists all the people that work for your company. You can add someone new with the add button at the top, or click on the line next to an employee's name to view and edit their details.</p>
                <P>Like the company, the employee details are split up into sections. To edit any of the sections simply click the edit button to the right. Then when you are finished click back to details to get back to the main screen.</P>

            <div id="people-personal">
                <h2>Personal</h2>
                <p>The personal section covers their contact information such as their address, phone number, and email. As well as a few points that relate to the payroll such as their marital status and if they require a work permit.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="people-salary">
                <h2>Employment and Salary</h2>
                <p>Employment and salary cover two halves. Their employment information such as the department, start date, status, and the payroll they belong to. </p>
                <p>The salary can be set in two ways. </p>
                <p>For monthly payrolls it is set from the top down, so you set the annual salary and update the weeks per year, days per week and hours per week as needed. Then Smart Pay works out the monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly rates from that. The salary breakdown link will let you manually override these if necessary.</p>
                <p>For weekly payrolls, it is set from the bottom up. So you set the hourly salary and up from there.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="people-pay-types">
                <h2>Pay Types</h2>
                <p>Pay types are pay components that could be included in a payroll for the employee but, are not worked out from the main salary. Possible examples are a holiday pay rate or a bonus for working on the weekend.</p>
                <p>You can add a new type by clicking the edit button on the right then, add a new type. For the new type, it will ask for a name, default units, and default value. The defaults can be overridden in the payroll but if you know what they are in advance it makes it easier to input each time. If both defaults have a value then the type will be added automatically to each new payroll. Otherwise, one can be left at zero and the type will be available in the payroll but won't be added automatically.</p>
                <p>The new type also has several flags that change the ways it behaves when the payroll run is completed. The flags work by deciding if the line total value for that type is included in various calculations.</p>

                <p>So for the weekend bonus example from before. It could be set up with a name of "Weekend Bonus", a default value of say, £100, why not it's a nice round number. Zero default units, because they don't get it unless they work at the weekend. Then a tick in Include when working out Tax, Include when working out NIee, and Include when working out Nier to included it in the normal tax deductions.</p>

                <p>Employer contributions, so contributions made by you the employer as an addition to the salary.</p>
                <p>Both of these types can be percentages of the salary or fixed values. If you put a value in the employee or employer contributions they will appear as separate lines on the payroll for that employee.</p>
